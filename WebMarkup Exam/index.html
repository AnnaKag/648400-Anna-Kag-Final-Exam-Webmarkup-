                    <p>
                    Welcome to Haarlem!
                    Literally every building and every street in the center of Haarlem has its own history and keeps city legends.
                    As soon as you leave the train, you will find yourself at one of the oldest railway stations in Holland.

                <aside> By the way, one of the episodes of the Hollywood blockbuster "Ocean's Twelve" and the Dutch film "Black Book" were filmed here.</aside>

                <p id="paragraph">
                 Haarlem is also notable for the fact that it is located very close to the main tourist places and cities of Holland: from Schiphol, Keukenhof, Leiden, The Hague, the North Sea.
                 For this reason, in my opinion, staying in Haarlem during a trip to Holland is a good idea.
                 The journey from Haarlem to Amsterdam, as well as the picturesque beaches of Zandvoort and Blumendahl, takes only 15 minutes. 
                 Which way to go? Only you decide! The cozy vibe of Haarlem will help you spend your vacation away from the bustle of the capital.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    <p>Haarlem (Netherlands) is a Dutch town located 20 km from Amsterdam.
                    This is a very beautiful and cozy place with many attractions, and, unlike the capital, there are not many tourists.</p>
                    
                    <aside>General information</aside>
                    <p> Haarlem is a city located in the northern part of the Netherlands on the Sparne River. 
                    It is the capital of North Holland. The population is about 156 thousand people. This is one of the oldest cities in the Netherlands, the first information about which dates back to the X century. 
                    In the 1150s, a large village turned into a vibrant city. The name Harlem itself is derived from the words Haaro-heim or Harulahem, which literally translates as “a high sandy place where trees grow”. 
                    You can verify the name by looking at the photo of Haarlem.</p>

                    <img src="img/hr3.png"/>

                    <aside>History</aside>       
                   <p> Over its centuries-old history, Haarlem survived many invasions (sieges of 1270, 1428, 1572-1573), severe fires of 1328, 1347 and 1351, the plague epidemic in 1381.
                    The city is considered the 17th century as a golden age for the city; economic growth began in the country, a large number of wealthy citizens started to appear, and art began to develop.
                    And the 17th century in Holland is, first of all, the heyday of architecture. Most of today's attractions were developed at that time, and are still influential to this day.</p>

                    <aside>Living</aside>  
                   <p> Haarlem (Holland) is a small city, but there are no problems with hotels. 
                       The cheapest room in a 3 * hotel for two will cost around $80 (breakfast included) per night. 
                       Haarlem is a fairly "compact" city, so all the hotels are close to attractions.</p>

                    <aside>Food</aside>      
                    <p>There are many cafes and restaurants in the city, but the prices are quite high.</p>
                       <p>For example:</p> 
                           <li>the average bill in an inexpensive restaurant is 30-40 euros for a dinner for two;</li> 
                           <li>dinner for two in a middle-class restaurant will cost 60 € on average;</li> 
                           <li>a glass of local beer 0.5l - 5 €;</li> 
                           <li>a cup of cappuccino - 4.5 €.</li> 

                    <p>It is clear that cooking yourself is much more budget-friendly. The cheapest products can be found in chain stores Albert Heijn, Jumbo, Dirk van den Broek, ALDI and Lidl.</p>

                            Taekwondo (translated from Korean means the path of the hand and the fist) is Korean martial art, including a spiritual training system and self-defence technique without weapons, which appeared more than 2000 years ago and was revived in 1955 by Choi Hong-hee.
                            The demonstration of taekwondo is a very spectacular sight: athletes perform high jumps, they smash objects with their feet, hands and head. 
                            Fights in this type of martial arts are also interesting, they are characterized by activity, the use of a variety of striking techniques, especially with the use of legs, and jumps. 
                            But this is only the outer shell - like other oriental martial arts, taekwondo includes, along with technical aspects, a deep philosophy and value system, among which are: etiquette, respect, courtesy, conscience, morality, patience, self-control, courage.
                            Korean martial arts contain a number of disciplines that help to educate a comprehensively developed skilful fighter: the implementation of formal complexes (analogues of kata in karate), fights, kicking in jumps, breaking objects, application (self-defence).
